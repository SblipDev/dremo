## Installation and Running the code.

#### Python side: 

use pip to install all the dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After the dependencies are installed, run the following commands. 

```
$ python3 manage.py migrate
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

If the following commands execute without any problems, the backend server has started. Now keep the server running as we go to the javascript instructions.

#### Javascript Side

Go in the frontend/ directory of the repository using this command, 

```
$ cd frontend/
``` 

and to install all the dependencies, run this command ->

```
$ npm install
```

now we have to run the server ->

```
$ npm run serve
```

Please keep sure that both the servers are running, then open `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. If its working, you will be able to see the home page.
